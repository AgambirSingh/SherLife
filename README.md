## **Our Story Behind SherLife**

### **What Inspired Us**

At Sheridan, we encountered several challenges that motivated us to create **SherLife**, a platform designed to simplify and enhance student life. Hereâ€™s what inspired us:

- **Missing Out on Events:** Staying informed about campus events and updates was difficult, leaving us feeling disconnected.
- **Navigating Multiple Resources:** Finding information across various Sheridan platforms was overwhelming and time-consuming.
- **Lack of a Dedicated Marketplace:** There wasnâ€™t a platform exclusively for Sheridan students to buy, sell, or exchange items.
- **Limited Professor Reviews:** Platforms like RateMyProfessor often lacked feedback on Sheridan professors, making it hard to gather insights.
- **Confession Board for Mental Health:** We recognized that the confession board could serve as more than just a place for anonymous confessions. It can also be a space for students to share their struggles, seek support, and connect with others who have experienced similar challenges. This dual-purpose functionality inspired us to make mental health a core aspect of our platform.

These pain points inspired us to design a solution tailored to Sheridan students' unique needs.

### **What We Learned**

Through building SherLife, we gained invaluable lessons:

- **Teamwork and Adaptability:** We initially distributed tasks equally but learned that being flexible and redistributing tasks based on individual strengths was more effective.
- **Leveraging Strengths:** Understanding each other's skills allowed us to assign tasks that played to everyone's expertise, improving efficiency and collaboration.
- **Iterative Development:** We embraced an iterative approach, incorporating continuous feedback to refine our project.

### **How We Built Our Project**

#### **From Concept to Prototype**

Our journey began with an intense brainstorming session, debating ideas until the early hours of the morning. After some rest, **Agam** took the initiative to develop a prototype that blended everyone's input. This prototype became the foundation for SherLife.

### **Challenges We Faced**

1. **Debating the Concept:**
   Agreeing on a direction was tough. After hours of discussion, we realized compromise and taking breaks were essential. The prototype was the breakthrough that united our vision.

2. **Time Management:**
   Balancing academic responsibilities with hackathon deadlines was challenging. Effective delegation and collaboration helped us meet our goals without sacrificing quality.

3. **Technical Hurdles:**
   Implementing machine learning algorithms was a steep learning curve. Iterative testing and refinement allowed us to achieve impactful recommendations.

### **The Final Product**

Our perseverance paid off, resulting in **SherLife**, a platform designed to meet the needs of Sheridan students. Key features include:

- **Confession Board:** An anonymous forum for sharing thoughts and experiences. It also serves as a safe space for discussing mental health, where students can seek support and share their stories.
